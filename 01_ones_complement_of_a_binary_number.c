/*
Write a C program to input binary number from user and find ones complement of binary number using loop.
How to find 1s complement of a binary number in C programming.
Logic to find ones complement of binary number in C programming.

Ones complement of a binary number is defined as value obtained by inverting all binary bits.
Í„It is the result of swapping all 1s to 0s and all 0s to 1s.
